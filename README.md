## Project Overview
A Jupyter notebook where I explore multiple neural network architectures to classify a dataset of 7,000 labeled Pokémon images. 

## Models Tested
- **MobileNet_v2**: Lightweight architecture for mobile and edge devices.
- **EfficientNet_B0**: Balanced model for efficiency and accuracy.
- **MNASNet0_5**: Mobile inverted bottleneck architecture using depthwise separable convolutions.
- **ShuffleNet_v2_x1_0**: Designed for computational efficiency with a novel channel shuffle operation.
- **ResNeXt50_32x4d**: Uses grouped convolutions to offer a trade-off between depth and width.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 7,000 labeled images of Pokémon, categorized by various Pokémon species. The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lantian773030/pokemonclassification).
